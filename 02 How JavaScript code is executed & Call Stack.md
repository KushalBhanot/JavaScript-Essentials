- Execution Context works in two phases: memory allocation and code execution
- In the first run(memory allocation), memory will be allocated to your data types and functions
  - variables will store "undefined"
  - function will have all the code inside their block
- In the second run(code execution), actual values are assigned
  - functions behave differently in JS
  - whenever a function is invoked a whole new execution context is created just for the function
  - after the return statement is executed, the execution context of that function is deleted
- When you invoke a function, you pass an "arguement" and when you define a function, you define a "parameter"
  - invoke: arguement, define: parameter
- Call Stack is populated initially by Global Execution Contexts and more contexts are pushed onto it and they pop one by one
- "Call Stack maintains the order of execution of execution contexts"
- Call Stack is also known as:
  - Execution Context Stack
  - Program Stack
  - Context Stack
  - Runtime Stack
  - Machine Stack
